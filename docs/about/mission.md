# The MetaHQ Mission

We aim for MetaHQ to become a hub for **high-quality annotations** for biomedical data of all types.

The construction of the MetaHQ database would not be possible without efforts from the greater biomedical
research community. All of our annotations come from fellow researchers interested in using publicly
available biomedical data that understand the difficulty in finding samples and studies of interest.

We encourage researchers to submit their high-quality, manually curated annotations to be included in
the MetaHQ database! See our [Contributing](../contribute/index.md) docs for information on how
to contribute.
