# Codebase contributions

We welcome code contributions that enhance MetaHQ's functionality, fix bugs, or improve performance. Examples of substantial codebase contributions include:

- New features or modules
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage improvements
- Significant refactoring

**Note on documentation changes:** While we appreciate improvements to documentation, changes limited to README files, typo fixes, or minor formatting adjustments alone <u>do not typically qualify for authorship</u>.
However, documentation contributions paired with code changes, or comprehensive documentation efforts (e.g., adding detailed API documentation, tutorials, or usage guides) are valued and considered <u>substantial contributions</u>.
